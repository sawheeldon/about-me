About Me 

Intro

Hi, 

I am Simon Wheeldon, an entreprenuer and a general go getter. I've set up 3 businesses to date. 1 failed, 1 is on its last legs and 1 is in its infancy and is looking pretty promising. I am learning to code because my brain is filled with ideas and I can't afford to keep hiring/giving away parts of my companies to people who have skills that I can/should be able to learn. Hence here I am, pushing the boat out, moving out of myh comfort zone and taking on the world, one line at a time. :)

Fairness
Business Sense

Philanthropy
